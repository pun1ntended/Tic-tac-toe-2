1. Process
	A. consider player perspective
		- how does the player interact with the game
		- win/loss/draw
		- game loop for each turn
		- check win condition after each turn
		- check if move is valid

	B. consider board perspective
		- board is static
		- player does not change
		- model objects from perspective of board
		- game procedure 

	C. How does tic tac toe work
		- object modelling
		- player class
		- board
		- requirements of each model
		- methods needed
		- how do objects talk to each other?


	 1. Feature specifications
		1. Sign up
			- Enter a name
			- Does user exist?
			- Create a new user if user does not exist

	    Person is a subclass of the player class
		    player could be user or computer
		    class Person < Player

	 2 .Object Modelling
	 	- methods in each model/object
	 	- how do they relate to one another?
	 		- belongs to
	 		- has many
	 	- 
2. Domain Modeling

3. Setup

4. Composition
